# Designing and Debugging

# Rules for if-statements
#   1. Every if-statement must have an else.
#   2. If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies, 
#      just like we did in the last exercise. This will help find many errors.
#   3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
#   4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
#   5. Your Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calcuations to variables earlier in the function and use a good name for the variable.

# Note: Follow these simple rules. You'll start writing good code. Return to exercise 35 and see what rules were broken.
# Double-note: For practice, we should follow these rules to build good habits. However, not all rules will work in real life. Be pragmatic.

# Rules for Loops
#   1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probablt never. Remember, other languages may use while-loops differently than Python.
#   2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of loop, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over (like a list).

# Tips for Debugging
#   1. Do not use a "debugger". It may not provide you with any specific useful information, too much information or just a dish of confusion.
#   2. The best way to debug a program is to use the print command to print out the values of variables (aka var_dump in php) at points in the 
#      program to see where they go wrong.
#   3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Don't write massive, monstrous files of code before you try to run them. 
#      Code a little, run a little, fix a little.

# Homework
# Create a game similar to the one created in exercise 35. Take time over Thanksgiving 2019 break (Thurs â€“ Sun) to make it as interesting as possible. For Study
# Drills, use lists, functions and modules (see Exercise 13) as much as possible, and find as many new pieces of Python as possible to make the game work.
#  
# Before you start coding, you must draw a map for our game. You should create rooms, monsters, traps, etc ALL on paper before you code.
# 
# Once you have our map, try to code it up. If you encounter problems with the map, adjust it and make the code match.
# 
# The best way to work on a piece of software is in small chunks. Here are some tips:
#   1. On a sheet of paper or an index card, write a list of tasks needed to complete the software. This is your to-do list.
#   2. Pick the easiest thing from the list to work on.
#   3. Write out English comments in your source file as a guide for how you want to accomplish this task in your code.
#   4. Write some of the code under the English comments.
#   5. Quickly run your script to see if the code works.
#   6. Keep working in a cycle of writing some code, running it to test it, and fixing it until it works.
#   7. Cross this tsak off your list, then pick up your next easiest task and repeat
