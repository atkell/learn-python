# The Function Checklist
1. Did we start our function with `def`?
2. Does our function have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
3. Did we put an open parenthsis right after the function name?
4. Did we put our arguments after the paraenthesis separate by commas?
5. Did we make each argument unique?
6. Did we put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?
7. Did we indent all lines of code we want in the function four spaces, no more or less (a tab)?
8. Did we end our function by going back to writing with no indent (aka dedenting)

## When we run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
1. Did we call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did we put the ( character after the name to run it?
3. Did we put the values we want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did we end the function call with a ) character?

## Repeat after me...
To "run", "call" or "use" a function all mean the same thing.
