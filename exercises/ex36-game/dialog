## introduction
the dream is always the same
the feeling of damp stone, cool against your warm cheek
a darkness, so complete it its emptiness, that you lose yourself
the fear is always present, surreal yet palabale all the same
the dream is always the same
except, you've never woken up within it before...

you first notice the feeling against your cheek
agains the palms of your hands
you realize you're supine, sprawled against what must be a floor
you reason with yourself that it surely must be better to stand
then remain laying here, waiting for who knows what to happen
at who knows when and for who knows why...
to stand, type `stand`
