# You Make a Game

# A note from Alex on 2019-03-31: Do to a variety of reasons I was
# unable to complete this exercise. I'm moving ahead in the interest
# of completeing this book.

# I also took a moment to update some settings in Sublime.


## Function Style
# Programmers call functions that are part of classes, "methods". It's
# annoying but you'll get used to it.

# Instead of naming a function (method) within a class after what the
# function does, consider naming it as if it is a command we are
# giving to the class.

# Keep functions small and simple. Don't forget this!


## Class Style
# A class should use "camel case" and not "underscore format".
# ThisIsCamelCase

# Do try and keep __init__ functions short and sweet.

# The functions within the class should user "underscore format" like
# my_awesome_dog and not MyAwesomeDog.


# Do be consistent in how you organize your function arguments.

# Variables should be self-contained and not from the modile or globals
# where or whenever possible.

# A foolish consistent is the hobggblin of little minds.
# Think for your self.

# Always, always, always have class Name(object) format or else you'll
# be in "trouble".


## Code Style
# Readibility counts. Give yourself and your code vertical space.

# If you cannot read it aloud, it's probably hard to read.

# For now, emulate what others are doing in Python until you develop
# your own style (see pep8).


## Good Comments
# Write comments. Ignore those who say otherwise.

# When you write comments, describe WHY you are doing what you are
# doing. Remember, the code itself already says HOW.

# Don't forget to review your comments if you change your code.
